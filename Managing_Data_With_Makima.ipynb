    "`BlueAutomata` is a Python package to provide a framework for reporting workflow automation. Generally, reporting involves gathering raw data, cleaning of raw data and compiling raw data into their respective template using Microsoft Excel. This package aims to automate the workflow of cleaning data, compiling data and preparing the data in reportable format on Excel by auto-calling the corresponding VBA function.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install the package:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install blueautomata\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To update the package:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install blueautomata --upgrade\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This package **cannot** run on cloud environment such as Kaggle and Google Collab that uses ubuntu OS due to the `pywin32` dependencies. Of course, you are encouraged to download the notebook and try on a Windows machine.\n",

    "## 0.1 Managing Data With Makima\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2066, Makima becomes the Manager of the Devil Hunter Club where she will be in charge of the Data Management of the Club. In the club, there are people from all walks of life such as Satoru Gojo, from `Jujutsu Kaisen` and Anya Forger from `Spy x Family`. In fact, these peole have their own department and they work in their own department. For example, `Jujutsu Kaisen` and `Kimetsu no Yaiba` and considered as one department respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "People in a department are known as actors for the club and they will be assigned to different system or we can also call it genres whenever they are called upon by the studios like Mappa and CloverWorks. Every month, Makima would need to submit a report to Masamichi Yaga, the Club President to report on the work from each department with details such as what genres of TV shows they are involved in and which studios used them. \n",
    "\n",
    "The typical report looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Department | Dept | User ID | Name | System1 | Cube |\n",
    "|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n",
    "|Jujutsu Kaisen | 呪術廻戦 | satorugojo | Satoru Gojo | ACTION | Mappa |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, every month Makima will receive raw data collected by her Devil Hunter members, Aki, Power and Denji and the data formats are often inconsistent but Makima has her ways to deal with the inconsistencies. In general the raw data will have the format as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| User ID | role code |\n",
    "|----------|----------|\n",
    "| satorugojo | mapp |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The example above looks clean, but sometimes the system, name, role code are not given but only User ID is given and real data might not be very clean to begin with. So Makima has to rely on her club members database and checklist that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Club Members Database**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Department | Dept | User ID | Name |\n",
    "|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Checklist 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "| cube | cube_name |\n",
    "|----------|----------|\n",
    "| mapp | Mappa |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These data allows Makima to perfrom cross referencing whenever there are missing information in the raw data she received. Let's see how Makima prepare her report with the below code👇\n",
